### Structure 

The site contains three pages - Home, Gallery and Contact. Each page is designed in linear style.
The Home page contains all the information for commercial purposes (booking, offers) and is designed 
that way specifically with the business objectives in mind. The supplemenatary information is contained in the
Gallery and Contact page. 

### Skeleton 
I designed the general structure of the site using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) to create a wireframe for each of the three pages on large screens.

- [Home Page](/assets/images/home-wireframe.png)
- [Gallery Page](/assets/images/gallery-wireframe.png)
- [Contact Page](/assets/images/contact-wireframe.png)

All pages contain the same navigation menu and footer. The navigation menu is fixed to the top. 
The Home page is deivided into three sections - Main Section (which includes a callout and booking form), About Section and Offers Section.
The Gallery page is divided into three sections - a Title Section, Image Gallery Section and Bottom Section. 
The Contact page is divided into one main Contact section which was divided into two seperate sections of a Contact Form and Contact Section. 

#### Responsive Design
- On the Home page, for small screens the alert box is removed. In the Offers Section, images are removed from the cards which are stacked vertically. 
On medium screens, everything is displayed as in large except in Offers Section two of the cards are stacked vertically on top of one card.
- On the Gallery page, on large screens there is an image gallery of four columns in three rows. On medium screens there are two columns in six rows. 
on small screens there are one columns with 12 rows.
- On the Contact page, for small screens the Contact section is removed. Medium and large screens dispaly same information.

The site uses an assortment of colours. The predominant colour scheme is a combination of white, gold and grey. These colours are used throughout the site (inlcuding the site's logo, font and background colors). Many of
the same colours are resued in different sections of the site with lighter or darker versions of the colours used for contrast purposes. On the Gallery page, a black background 
colour is utilised in the photo gallery to contrast the brightness of the images. 

### Typography 

[EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond)

This font was used for all elememts on the site. The font was chosen as it aligns with the luxurious aspirations of the hotel.
